# Day 1 Report

## Summary
- Understood the Drizzle ORM, focusing on the creation of a new schema for storing user badges.
- Created the **Badges** schema to track the badges awarded to users.
  
## Tasks Completed
- Created a new schema for badges, where each user can have multiple badges linked to them.
- Set up the necessary fields in the schema, including:
  - Badge name
  - User ID
  - Date awarded
  - Criteria for badge assignment
  
- Developed an API endpoint to create and assign badges to users.

## Challenges Faced
- Minor challenges with schema structure adjustments for scalability.
  
## Next Steps
- Plan to work on the badge creation logic triggered by interview performance. The badge will be awarded when an interview score exceeds 7.
